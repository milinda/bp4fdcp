# TODO

- Since openopt does not allow the use of packing constraint such as not allowing the leader replica and a follow replica of a partition in the same bin, we need to come up with our own solution. [Variable-Size-Vector-Bin-Packing](https://github.com/mgabay/Variable-Size-Vector-Bin-Packing) is a good start.
